**Notes:**

* GitHub workflow in The Turing Way
* In the bookdash we're not necessairly working on code/scripts (although that is part of the book), we're focusing on the documentation/collaborative part
* GitHub also facilitates acknowledging contributions/providing credit (the Turing Way does this through the contributor-bot)
* You are your number 1 collaborator in six months time! Commits and documentation are important :) We deserve kindness to ourselves and have clear commit messages!
* If people don't see what is happening it is difficult for them to collaborate with you
* For reviews: It is helpful to add comments, but even more helpful if you can directly make suggested changes in your review comments
