# Software Management Plan
## Introduction
A Software Management Plan (SMP), similar to a {ref}`rr-rdm-dmp`, is a document that describes how your software will be generated, used and shared during and after your project.
And similar to a DMP, an SMP is a living document, which should be updated throughout the research project as needed.

One important thing to say in this context is that software includes a wide range of things: from analysis code used by only one researcher to software libraries with many users. See {ref}`below<rr-rdm-smp-what-software>` for more details.

Here is [a good introduction to SMPs](https://tu-delft-dcc.github.io/docs/software/software_management_plan.html).

In their [recommendations for Developing and Aligning Policies on Research Software](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13740998), Science Europe recommend to "Provide guidance regarding research software management".

### What it is?
An SMP is a document which describes how a specific software project will be developed and maintained, and over what period of time.
It describes, for example, how the software will manage version control, how it will be licensed, how it will manage license compatibility, and so on.

More than a document, a SMP should be a way for developers of research software to reflect on their process, make their choices more explicit, and consider what options are available to them.
Ideally, this reflection should happen early on in the development process, and should be revised and updated on a regular basis.

### How can they benefit your research?
An SMP can help the developers make explict their intentions and choices on how they will manage their software project.
If you plan on sharing your code, it will help you ensure that your code is reusable by others.

### What software to manage?
Some researchers say they do not create any software, they only write one-off scripts to analyse data.
These scripts, short as they may be, are still software.
The Australian [A National Agenda for Research Software](https://ardc.edu.au/project/research-software-agenda-for-australia/) proposes different categories of research software: analysis code, prototype tools, infrastructure software.
The key point is that SMPs apply to research software across this spectrum, although it may apply differently depending on the needs of the software.
